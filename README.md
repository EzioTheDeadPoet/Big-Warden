# Big Warden

January 15th, 2021 - Full Install: ~37GB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with the last few finishing steps necessary to enjoy Big Warden as I envisioned, and currently play, it. 

## GOALS


-  Put the finishing touches on your Big Warden installation

-  Get you playing the game as quickly as possible

## SPECIFICATIONS

- Due to the way .DAZIPs work, you will need to follow a few instructions before you're completely ready. Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit, so long as you're capable of following instructions.

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL Steam installation of Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition (note: I am using this on Steam, and am unsure if this will work with Origin. It DOES require all of the DLC, so Ultimate Edition is likely required.)

## Install Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Dragon Age Origins). 

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and choose "Configure". Then, in the Video Settings, choose whichever options you desire. (I maxxed mine out with a 16:9 display, and to skip the intro movies)

Install Big Warden via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modists". 

3.  From there, you will download "Big Warden" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/Big Warden", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Dragon Age Origins folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.

Install the remaining DAZIPs
---------------------------------

Now comes the only part you really need to do:

1. Upon finishing the Big Warden installation, navigate to Steam/steamapps/common/Dragon Age Ultimate Edition/bin_ship

2. Click on the program titled DAUpdater.exe

3. Choose "Select DAZIPs", and navigate to your Big Warden installation folder. 

4. There, inside of Game Folder Files, will be 8 DAZIPs that you will need to install using the DAUpdater. Simply select them, and they should appear in DAUpdater.

5. Select all of the DAZIPs within DAUpdater, and choose "Install Selected".

6. Wait for all of them to read "installed". Afterwards, you may close the program. 

7. See the bottom of this ReadMe for instructions to make Awakening in the OC work for you. Believe me, it's worth it.

# Finishing up Awakening in the OC

#### The following instructions are copied verbatim from the mod's page. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find the equivalent of your Program Files\Dragon Age\packages\core_ep1\data directory.

2. Copy all of the .erf files found there.

3. Find the \BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core\data directory.

4. Paste the copied .erfs into that folder.

5. Find the equivalent of your Program Files\Dragon Age\packages\core_ep1 directory.

6. Copy the texture folder.

7. Paste the copied folder into the \BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core directory.

8. Find the equivalent of your Program Files\Dragon Age\packages\core_ep1\audio\sound directory.

9. Copy the three vfx_spells files.

1. Paste them into the \BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core\audio\sound directory (create it if it doesn't exist).

1. Activate the 'Awakening in the OC' Addon via the Downloadable Contents menu in-game.

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the DAZIPs, you may open the ModOrganizer.exe present in your Big Warden folder. In the top right, Dragon Age Origins should already be selected. Simply click Play to begin your Origins adventure!

## Mods to be aware of

- Human Noble Background Immersion - Expands the Human Noble background, currently removing the protected flag on a certain NPC and giving the guards unique names. More will come in future updates, and I'll be on the lookout for those. 

- Skip the Fade/ Skip Ostagar - These mods do as written, and warrant no further explination. If you would rather not skip these, disable them at the bottom of Mod Organizer.

- DABIK - 1440p cutscenes for better pre-rendered goodness. There is a 4K option, but I went with 1440 to make sure it was more accessible.

- Awakening in the OC - This is THE big one. This mod pulls in skills, talents, and abilities from Awakening into the base game. It also raises the level cap to 35. An amazing mod that's bound to be fun for everyone.
